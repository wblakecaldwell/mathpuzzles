Math Puzzles for Kids!
======================

This is the beginning of a collection of puzzles for kids who are learning basic math.


[Puzzle #1: Multi-Crypto](multicrypto/)
-----------------------

Multi-Crypto is a simple puzzle generator to help kids work on their multiplication 
and subtraction, while feeling like a spy decoding a secret message. A puzzle 
encodes a phrase, where each letter is represented by a math problem in the form of:

    (a x b) - (c x d)

with the result being an index between 1-26, representing a position in the decoder
key. The decoder key is deciphered just as the secret message is: with math problems.

Check out [this example](multicrypto/EXAMPLE.md) of a Multi-Crypto puzzle.
